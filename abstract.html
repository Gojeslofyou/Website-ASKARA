        Ursula Junior High School in Jakarta. This program is made to help students improve teamwork and creativity. ILP
        also brings together several subjects to create a project, among other activities. ILP is a method that is used
        to combine different subjects into one task, helping students connect ideas from different lessons. The main
        goal of ILP is to help students apply the knowledge they have learned in real situations and develop their
        thinking skills. Through this method, students work together and use creativity to finish projects, which helps
        improve their skills and communication. ILP also helps students be more active in learning because they are
        involved in applying what they know. Therefore, ILP plays an important role in preparing students for the skills
        they need in the future.

        At SMP Santa Ursula Jakarta, we were assigned a task to create a bazaar project in groups of six. Our group
        name, Dieng ‘Et ASKARA, was the final group name discussed by our group. This group name has 2 components.
        “ASKARA” is a combination of 2 words, Anak Sanur and Nusantara, and “Dieng ‘Et” is our theme, where the
        researcher’s will include the highland in the decor of our booth and the researcher’s products. Not only that,
        ASKARA comes from the Sanskrit language, that means light or radiating light. The name ASKARA becomes a form of
        representation of us, as students of Santa Ursula Jakarta, to innovate and try to contribute in the making of
        various types of products that will be sold to the general public. From here, it can increasingly show that
        Santa Ursula students can have their own creations and are able to build and develop themselves into better
        individuals. The products were bought to resell. The packaging was designed to be attractive, and promotions
        were made on social media, including pre-orders being opened before the event started.
    <br>
    <br>
        After that, we worked hard to prepare everything, like making sure our booth was set up with a neat design, the
        products were sold, and the art performance and dance were planned. Each member of the group had their own role,
        and we helped each other to get everything done well. The booth was checked for any last-minute changes before
        the bazaar began. We also learned to be more confident and responsible while working together.
        The main goal of this project was to develop our skills in collaborating, dividing tasks, and committing to
        finishing each task properly. Through this experience, we not only earned good grades, but we also gained
        valuable skills for the future, like good communication, creativity, and better organizational skills. We are
        proud of what was achieved together.
    <br>
    <br>
        In conclusion, this project was considered a valuable learning opportunity for those students that want to
        extend their knowledge beyond books. Preparing them for future challenges, we learnt that teamwork, creativity,
        and an open-mind are important for the coming life.
